This is a test repository.

We will use this repository to do python excercises.

First, clone [usrp_sciprog](https://github.com/changgoo/usrp-sciprog) and copy the files under day2/ 

```
cp -rp your_path_to_the_usrp_repo/usrp-sciprog/day2/* .
```

Replace _your_path_to_the_usrp_repo_ to the correct one. In my case, it was `/Users/ckim/Sources/usrp_sciprog`.

Second, create a clean environment for this excercise (you don't need to do if you are familiar with python already).

```
conda create --name usrp python=3.8
```

Install basic packages 

```
conda install matplotlib numpy jupyter ipython
```
